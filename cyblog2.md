Simple Serverless programmin in Google Cloud using Pulumi.

A main goal of Pulumi is to help simplify, or outright remove, the myriad forms of complexity around programming the cloud.  One of the main forms of complexity removed is needing to either manually create your infrastructure through cloud CLIs, or using different and esoteric languages to try to declare and maintain your cloud infrastructure.  Instead, we think you should be able to use the programming languages you know and are already comfortable with to easily define and maintain using the languages, libraries, patterns and abstractions you're already comfortable with.

Serverless programming is another area we want to bring the same convenience and simplicity to cloud programming.  The main goal of Serverless programming is to enable users to just define a piece of code they want to run in the cloud in response to some event.  The cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) is then responsible for executing that code by dynamically allocating (and charging for) the resources necessary for it.  The code is typically run inside stateless containers that can be triggered by a variety of events including http requests, bucket changes, pubsub messages, cron jobs, db events, etc.  However, while the different cloud providers make it simple to scale infrastructure for your Serverless code, it's often overly complex to actually supply them with the code you want to run, define when you want to run it, and then provide your code with the necessary information to access and effectively interact with the rest of your infrastructure.
